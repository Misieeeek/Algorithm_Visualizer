# Algorithm Visualizer

## A desktop application made in C++ using the SFML library, created to visualise algorithms

This project is mainly used to visualise algorithms, but an additional benefit is learning. That is, understanding how a particular algorithm works. The project is mainly based on the literature ‘Introduction to Algorithms’ by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, Clifford Stein.
I have divided the algorithms into 7 groups:

- Sorting algorithms
- Search algorithms
- Data structures
- Dynamic programming
- Advanced data structures
- Graph algorithms
